 * TODO in this branch

   * Multidimensional arrays. 
   * Global arrays should have a size.
   * Experiment with Dynamic size on local arrays. 
     - How to deal with this. Memory allocation, etc. 
     - The size can most likely not "really" be dynamic. 
       but it may be beneficial to have Exp Word32 as size of local 
       arrays (for uniformity). 
       Otherwise this may complicate compilation much.
