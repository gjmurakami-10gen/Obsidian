* pushS, pushN: Look at ways to push more than one element per thread.
  Do not push adjacent elements! 
    
* Get all example files up to date with current implementation.

* See if there is something awkward with mapG and number of threads 
  when it comes to writing the global array. 

* See what the state of the CSE is. Does it work in this new setting? 
  Or is a lot of coding needed? 

* DONE: Investigate why __attribute__ might fail (on windows) 
  you need to do __declspec(align(16))

* DONE: Investigate why a size is needed on shared memory array declarations (on windows) 
  The programmers manual specifies that you should not be required to 
  specify a size if you do: 
   extern __shared__ type name[]; 
  The size is given later in the execution configuration:
  func<<<blocks, threads, sharedBytes>>>(parameters); 

* See if special global kernels that cache in shared memory once 
  and they directly outputs to global memory can be implemented in 
  a way that does not require a __syncthreads();
