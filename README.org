* Obsidian

    + TODO: Look at code generation, is there a problem with the memory management ? 
    + TODO: global arrays have sizes! make the code generation aware of this! 
        

* IMPORTANT TODOs
  + update the SPDMC based code outputer (cleaner, nicer) 
  + Change CodeGen.Program to a completely first order representation! 
  + update genProg function

* Next version of Obsidian
  * Features (in progress): 
     + Only one kind of Pull array.
       However, it can have either Dynamic or Statically known length.
     + A Set of lift functional that lifts local computations 
       to global, lifts sequential into local. 
     + A collection of sequential building blocks for sequential (reg->reg 
       computations). 
       
       * Currently: 
          + Fold 
          + Scan 
          + Sort (todo). How ? Which kind of sort. 
	    I want one with known number of iterations and in-place capability. 
          + Merge (todo) 
          + Filter (todo)
