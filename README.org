* Obsidian
  
  An embedded language for GPU kernel programming. 
  
  * Current features 
    + Pull arrays
    + Push arrays 
    + Mutable arrays 
        

* TODOs
  + TODO: Look at code generation, is there a problem with the memory management ? 
  + TODO: global arrays have sizes! make the code generation aware of this! 
  + Think about completely dissallowing Int and Word as types in Obsidian programs.
    Require that the programmer explicitly makes a Int32, Int64, Word32, Word64 Choice-
  + (In Progress) update the SPDMC based code outputer (cleaner, nicer) 
  + clean up and check for bugs in: 
    * CodeGen.Memory.hs
    * CodeGen.Liveness.hs 
  + The CSE code is definitely completely broken in relation 
    to all news now.
  + Make sure unnecessary usage of shared memory can be avoided.    

* Next version of Obsidian
  * Features (in progress): 
     + Only one kind of Pull array.
       However, it can have either Dynamic or Statically known length.
     + A Set of lift functional that lifts local computations 
       to global, lifts sequential into local. 
     + A collection of sequential building blocks for sequential (reg->reg 
       computations). 
       
       * Currently: 
          + Fold 
          + Scan 
          + Sort (todo). How ? Which kind of sort. 
	    I want one with known number of iterations and in-place capability. 
          + Merge (todo) 
          + Filter (todo, Tricky, whats the lengths?)
